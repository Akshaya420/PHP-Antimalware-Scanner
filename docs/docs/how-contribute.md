### How to report a malware

Acquiring samples of malicious code enables us to provide this protection to recognize new threats before they can infect your environment.

If you encounter a suspicious file, we encourage you to submit it to raising a new [ISSUE](https://github.com/marcocesarato/PHP-Antimalware-Scanner/issues) for analysis and further action if required.

If you have a pattern/definition to find this malicious code yet, you can create [PULL REQUEST](https://github.com/marcocesarato/PHP-Antimalware-Scanner/pulls) adding the *dangerous function, exploit or signature* to the related collection file.
After that your pull request will be analyzed and after approved or reviewed.

### Who can submit files?

Anyone can submit files for analysis. 
Our automated system checks all submitted files for malicious or potentially unwanted activity.

Files that require manual analysis are prioritized according to their level of severity, and the number of users the file may harm. 
After manual analysis, the file is categorized as either safe, or harmful.
