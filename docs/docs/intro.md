## PHP Antimalware Scanner

PHP Antimalware Scanner is a free tool to scan PHP files and analyze your project to find any malicious code inside it.

It provides an interactive text terminal console interface to scan a file, or all files in a given directory, and find PHP code files that seem to contain malicious
code. When a probable malware is detected, will be asked what action to take (like add to whitelist, delete files, try
clean infected code etc...).

the terminal console. In that case the results will be stored in a report file in html (default) or text
